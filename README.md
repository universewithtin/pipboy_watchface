# PipBoy watchface for WearOS

![GIF](misc/pipboy_wf.gif)

Simple watch face for an Wear OS devices. Only for circular devices. Created using Samsung's [WatchFaceStudio](https://developer.samsung.com/watch-face-studio/download.html) (WFS), so it is not really sophisticated, and quite a number of things can only be added using some trick, if ever.

> No real sourcefile is attached, as WFS uses sigle savefile. Said savefile is, in fact, just an easily extractable archive. But i don't feel like extracting savefile, committing changes and uploading next version by 'Releases' every time I have to do something. This watchface was made for fun in few hours total and only some requests after sharing this only made me change some aspects and describe it better.

## Behaviour

Everything is on the screen. Except...

1. Changing parts are:
* Three PipBoy animations (the ones i was able to find and seemed fitting - walking, wakingup/goingtosleep, resting);
* Extra animation for heartbeat > 140 - adrenaline/exhaustion.
* Low charge indicator for % < 35. Just text, though.
* Charging indicator.
2. Invisible shortcuts (complications).
